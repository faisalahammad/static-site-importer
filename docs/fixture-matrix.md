# Static Site Importer Rigs

`static-site-importer-fixture-matrix` is a product-level fixture matrix for Static
Site Importer quality checks. It keeps SSI-specific defaults, fixture discovery,
expected artifact names, and diagnostic grouping in this package while invoking
generic Homeboy/Homeboy Extensions primitives for WP Codebox recipe execution.

```bash
homeboy rig check static-site-importer-fixture-matrix
node bench/static-site-fixture-matrix.bench.mjs \
  --static-site-importer-path ~/Developer/static-site-importer \
  --blocks-engine-php-transformer-path ~/Developer/blocks-engine \
  --fixture-root ~/Developer/blocks-engine/fixtures/websites
```

Generated/static artifact roots can be normalized into matrix fixtures first:

```bash
node tools/artifact-intake.mjs \
  --artifact-root /path/to/generated-artifacts \
  --fixture-root /tmp/ssi-fixtures \
  --manifest /tmp/ssi-fixtures/intake.json

node bench/static-site-fixture-matrix.bench.mjs \
  --artifact-root /path/to/generated-artifacts \
  --output-directory /tmp/ssi-matrix \
  --static-site-importer-path ~/Developer/static-site-importer
```

Add `--run` only in an approved non-local execution environment. The default
command writes matrix, recipe, summary, result, and finding-packet artifacts
without launching WP Codebox.

Use `--blocks-engine-php-transformer-path` to test a local Blocks Engine checkout
without cutting a PHP transformer release first. The bench installs SSI's
Composer dependencies through a temporary path repository and records the
override in `cli-run.json` under `dependency_overrides`. The path may point at
either the Blocks Engine repo root or the `php-transformer/` package directory.

## Canonical Blocks Engine Matrix

Use the operator wrapper for the release-free development loop against the
canonical Blocks Engine fixture corpus (`blocks-engine/fixtures/websites`):

```bash
node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --runner homeboy-lab \
  --static-site-importer ~/Developer/static-site-importer \
  --blocks-engine ~/Developer/blocks-engine
```

The wrapper composes the existing Homeboy surfaces rather than replacing the
lower-level bench:

- `homeboy rig install <this package> --id static-site-importer-fixture-matrix --reinstall`
- `homeboy rig sync static-site-importer-fixture-matrix`
- `homeboy bench --rig static-site-importer-fixture-matrix --profile fixture-matrix --iterations 1`

It sets the SSI matrix bench environment for the canonical fixture root, Static
Site Importer checkout, WP Codebox execution, and optional Blocks Engine PHP
transformer override. Lab-routed runs omit default `--shared-state` and
`--artifact-root` paths so Homeboy can choose runner-local locations; use
`--local` for host-local state paths, or pass explicit paths only when they exist
on the runner. By default, `--blocks-engine` also supplies the
release-free transformer override path. Use `--blocks-engine-php-transformer-path`
to point at a different repo/package, or run a final release/bump proof with
`--mode release-proof` and the released SSI dependency installed.

The fixture matrix is a deterministic transformer feedback gate, not a
performance benchmark. The rig and wrapper run a single Homeboy bench iteration
by default; use repeated runs only for explicitly separate performance work.

### Derived Fixture Coverage

The matrix has no maintained fixture-count policy. `index.html` in a real
fixture directory is the generic executable-fixture rule; an optional
`fixture.json` must be valid JSON object metadata and, when it declares
`fixture_class` or `class`, must use a canonical class value. Discovery,
operator preflight, and bench validation consume the same
`static-site-importer/fixture-matrix-coverage/v1` inventory.

The inventory separates `active` (`fixtures/websites`) and `solved`
(`fixtures/solved`) corpora. Each records stable IDs plus `selected`, `skipped`,
`malformed`, and `duplicates` rows with reasons. A valid fixture addition is
selected automatically without editing SSI. Execution fails closed for malformed
metadata, duplicate stable IDs, or an unfiltered eligible fixture omitted from a
matrix. Intentional lane filtering records `filter_mismatch` instead.
Stable IDs are globally unique across active and solved corpora: a collision is
rejected before lane selection and includes corpus, root, and fixture-path
attribution so it cannot overwrite shared artifact or result paths.

`summary.json`, `cli-run.json`, and the additive `fixture-coverage.json` include
the exact coverage inventory. `finding-packets.json` remains its legacy top-level
array shape for existing repair-fanout consumers.

## Three-Fig Fixture E2E

Use `tools/run-fig-fixture-e2e.mjs` for the cross-stack proof that selected
Figma fixtures can become working WordPress block themes without expanding the
fixture corpus. The wrapper composes existing repo-owned surfaces:

- Blocks Engine `figma-transformer/scripts/figma-fixture-matrix.php` transforms
  each `.fig` into static HTML/CSS/assets.
- SSI `bench/static-site-fixture-matrix.bench.mjs --artifact-root ... --run`
  imports those generated artifacts in WP Codebox and emits the standard matrix
  result, editor-quality, visual-parity, and finding-packet artifacts.
- `artifacts/fig-fixture-e2e/summary.json` aggregates pass/fail status with
  thresholds for exactly three fixtures, zero transform failures, zero import
  failures, zero Blocks Engine vector placeholders/missing assets, and a default
  minimum native conversion rate of `1`.

Example:

```bash
SSI_FIG_E2E_FIXTURES="/path/to/Fisiostetic.fig:/path/to/FSE Pilot Build Theme.fig:/path/to/Twenty Twenty-Five (Community).fig" \
node tools/run-fig-fixture-e2e.mjs \
  --blocks-engine /path/to/blocks-engine \
  --static-site-importer /path/to/static-site-importer \
  --output-directory /path/to/artifacts/fig-fixture-e2e \
  --run
```

The summary keeps the two architecture links separate. Blocks Engine transform
metrics are under `transform` and `metrics.transform_*`; SSI import/materialization
metrics are under `import_matrix` and `metrics.import_matrix_*`. Use these fields
for performance and quality regression gates instead of treating `.fig -> blocks`
as one opaque operation.

### Blocks Engine Acceptance Provider

SSI owns the adapter from concrete three-Fig E2E artifacts to Blocks Engine's
`blocks-engine/figma-wordpress-stage-evidence/v1` contract. It does not treat an
aggregate matrix status as evidence. It validates and copies Blocks Engine's Figma-owned
acceptance stage files, then combines them with SSI import/editor/fallback facts,
a deployable `wordpress-site-plan/v2`, isolated WordPress identities, and the
remaining downstream parity artifacts.

Run the provider after a real E2E run, choosing the evaluator output directory
up front so every reference is evaluator-relative:

```bash
node tools/fig-acceptance-provider.mjs \
  --fig /path/to/Fisiostetic.fig \
  --fixture-id fisiostetic \
  --fixture-output /tmp/figma-wordpress-acceptance/fixtures/fisiostetic \
  --transform-summary /path/to/artifacts/fig-fixture-e2e/figma-transform/summary.json \
  --matrix-result /path/to/artifacts/fig-fixture-e2e/ssi-matrix/static-site-fixture-matrix-result.json \
  --matrix-output /path/to/artifacts/fig-fixture-e2e/ssi-matrix \
  --site-plan /path/to/fisiostetic-site-plan.json
```

For the canonical run, supply the full provider config documented in
[`fig-acceptance-provider.md`](fig-acceptance-provider.md). The E2E command then
writes the combined manifest and invokes the evaluator directly:

```bash
node tools/run-fig-fixture-e2e.mjs \
  --blocks-engine /path/to/blocks-engine \
  --fixture /path/to/a.fig --fixture /path/to/b.fig --fixture /path/to/c.fig \
  --acceptance-config /path/to/acceptance-config.json \
  --run
```

Reviewer-facing artifacts are under
`/tmp/figma-wordpress-acceptance/fixtures/<fixture-id>/ssi-acceptance-provider/`:
`stages/*.json` are the 13 contract records, `artifacts/` contains copied
resolvable evidence, and `manifest-fragment.json` is the exact provider output.

To compare a candidate run to a saved baseline summary, pass the previous
`summary.json` and an allowed regression ratio:

```bash
node tools/run-fig-fixture-e2e.mjs \
  --blocks-engine /path/to/blocks-engine \
  --static-site-importer /path/to/static-site-importer \
  --baseline-summary /path/to/baseline/summary.json \
  --max-baseline-regression-ratio 0.10 \
  --max-import-findings 0 \
  --run
```

`baseline_comparison.deltas` reports signed deltas for stage durations and quality
counters. When `--max-baseline-regression-ratio` is set, positive deltas above the
budget fail the wrapper; leave it unset to collect comparison evidence without a
hard performance gate.

Pass fixture paths with repeated `--fixture <path>` arguments instead of
`SSI_FIG_E2E_FIXTURES` when that is easier for shells/scripts. Use `--dry-run` to
write `plan.json` and `summary.json` without running the transform/import steps.
Use `--expected-fixture-count` only for exploratory work; the release proof
defaults to the three named fixtures.

Sample summary shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "static-site-importer/fig-fixture-e2e-summary/v1",
  "status": "passed",
  "fixture_count": 3,
  "expected_fixture_count": 3,
  "metrics": {
    "transform_duration_ms": 12345,
    "import_matrix_duration_ms": 67890,
    "total_duration_ms": 80235,
    "transform_vector_placeholder_count": 0,
    "transform_missing_asset_count": 0,
    "import_matrix_finding_count": 0,
    "import_matrix_min_native_conversion_rate": 1
  },
  "transform": {
    "duration_ms": 12345,
    "completed_fixture_count": 3,
    "failed_fixture_count": 0,
    "vector_placeholder_count": 0,
    "missing_asset_count": 0
  },
  "import_matrix": {
    "enabled": true,
    "duration_ms": 67890,
    "passed_fixture_count": 3,
    "failed_fixture_count": 0,
    "finding_count": 0,
    "min_native_conversion_rate": 1
  }
}
```

Output is a JSON operator summary with the run ID, fixture count, pass/fail
counts, finding count, top buckets/kinds when present in Homeboy output, a
`run_refs` block with ready-to-run `homeboy runs show <id>` / `homeboy runs
artifacts <id>` commands, artifact URLs, and the structured Homeboy bench output
file. Pass `--dry-run` to inspect the composed commands without running
Lab/WP Codebox. Arguments after `--` are forwarded to the lower-level bench,
preserving the existing script options:

### Runtime evidence readiness

Each collected fixture includes `matrix_evidence` with the Composer-installed
`automattic/blocks-engine-php-transformer` package, version, and reference used
by that candidate runtime. It also includes a bounded (50 assets) projection of
the compiler materialization plan. Each asset records its path/source, role/kind,
type/placement, `defer`/`async`, and payload presence, SHA-256, and byte count;
payload source is never retained in the matrix output.

`summary.matrix_evidence_readiness` aggregates the fixture states. `verified`
means provenance and a current materialization plan were captured. Incomplete
outputs are explicitly `runtime_evidence_incomplete` (with the missing fields
listed), so they cannot be read as evidence of current released transformer
behavior. A dry, unexecuted matrix is `not_captured`.

Every matrix run also writes `visual-parity-evidence-report.json` and
`visual-parity-evidence-report.md`. These artifacts make the staged-output proof
less hand-wavy by reporting, per fixture, whether the generated site artifact,
staged source HTML, imported WordPress browser snapshot, visual-compare evidence,
screenshot refs, viewport/mobile evidence, live-WP parity, missing assets, and
native/core HTML block counts are present. The report is a deterministic evidence
coverage and risk summary; it complements screenshot/pixel diff evidence but does
not replace it.

### Code freshness guard

Before running, the wrapper resolves the git freshness of the override/source
checkouts (`--blocks-engine` / `--blocks-engine-php-transformer-path` and
`--static-site-importer`) relative to their upstream. The plan and operator
summary include a `code_freshness` block (per path: `branch`, `upstream`,
`behind`, `ahead`, `dirty`, `commit`, `status`) plus the resolved
`transformer_commit` so findings are attributable to the exact code under test.

If any override is **behind or diverged** vs upstream, the wrapper warns loudly
and **refuses to run** (exit non-zero) — a stale transformer produces
semantic-parity findings that may already be fixed upstream (phantom findings).
Refresh the checkout to upstream, or pass `--allow-stale-override` to proceed
anyway. `--dry-run` always prints the resolved freshness and whether it *would*
block, without running. Fresh/clean (or ahead-only) checkouts proceed with no
new friction.

```bash
node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --runner homeboy-lab \
  --static-site-importer ~/Developer/static-site-importer \
  --blocks-engine ~/Developer/blocks-engine \
  --batch-size 5 \
  --run-id ssi-matrix-dev-$(date +%Y%m%d) \
  -- --wordpress-version latest
```

Compare two fixture-matrix finding-packet artifacts without requiring Homeboy run
state:

```bash
node tools/compare-finding-packets.mjs \
  --base /path/to/main/finding-packets.json \
  --candidate /path/to/candidate/finding-packets.json \
  --base-label current-main \
  --candidate-label candidate \
  --top 20
```

The comparison reports signed count deltas by repair bucket, `group_key`, kind,
fixture, candidate repo, and selector family. Positive deltas mean the candidate
has more findings in that group; negative deltas mean fewer findings.

## Fixture Manifests (taxonomy / budgets)

Each fixture directory carries a `fixture.json` manifest authored alongside the
fixture (owned by the corpus repo, `blocks-engine/fixtures/websites`). The
manifest is the **sole source of truth** for a fixture's taxonomy — there is no
runtime classification heuristic and no directory-name fallback.

```json
{
  "fixture_class": "marketing/static",
  "tags": ["restaurant", "has-form", "multipage"],
  "capabilities": ["forms", "local-css"],
  "risk_profile": "low",
  "complexity": 1,
  "quality_budgets": {
    "max_unacceptable_findings": 0,
    "visual_mismatch_ratio": 0.1
  }
}
```

- `fixture_class` — **required** for known coverage. Must be one of the canonical `FIXTURE_CLASSES` values
  verbatim: `marketing/static`, `docs/blog`, `ecommerce/catalog`,
  `app/dashboard`, `canvas/webgl/audio/runtime-heavy`, `unknown`.
- `class` — legacy alias for `fixture_class`, still accepted. When both are
  present, `fixture_class` wins.
- `tags` — optional free-form string array, used for lane/tag querying.
- `capabilities` — optional authored string array for capability lanes such as
  `forms`, `commerce-products`, `checkout`, `runtime-js`, `webgl`, or `audio`.
- `risk_profile` — optional authored risk lane. Missing values normalize to
  `unknown`; suggested starting values are `low`, `medium`, `high`, and
  `extreme`.
- `complexity` — optional integer `1`–`5` (values out of range are clamped).
- `quality_budgets` — optional budget metadata copied into matrix artifacts and
  results. The matrix records these values but does not fabricate or enforce
  them unless a future gate explicitly consumes them.

Class resolution order: an explicit class injected by the runner/tests → the
manifest `fixture_class` → legacy manifest `class` → `unknown`. A missing manifest
or an invalid class value does **not** crash the run: that single fixture resolves
to `unknown` and a loud warning naming the fixture is written to stderr. Matrix
and result summaries include `manifest_coverage` with counts and fixture ids for
unknown taxonomy plus a warning-state `gate` block. This is metadata, not a
silent heuristic classification and not a hard failure.

Authored taxonomy fields are carried through onto each fixture, the per-fixture
result, artifact `source_metadata`, and summary rollups. Result summaries include
`fixture_classes`, `classes`, `capabilities`, `risk_profiles`, and
`quality_budgets` rollups.

Run a single lane or tag subset (matrix-wide, runner, or bench):

```bash
# Operator runner
node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --static-site-importer <path> --blocks-engine <path> \
  --class marketing/static --tag restaurant --capability forms --risk-profile low \
  --complexity 1 --max-complexity 2

# Bench directly (also via SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_CLASS / SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_TAG)
node bench/static-site-fixture-matrix.bench.mjs \
  --fixture-root <root> --class marketing/static --tag restaurant --capability forms --risk-profile low \
  --complexity 1 --max-complexity 2
```

`--class` selects a single class lane; `--tag` keeps only fixtures whose manifest
tags include the tag; `--capability` keeps only fixtures whose manifest
capabilities include the capability; `--risk-profile` selects one authored risk
lane; `--complexity` selects fixtures whose authored manifest complexity exactly
matches the integer; `--max-complexity` selects fixtures whose authored manifest
complexity is less than or equal to the integer. Filters intersect. When either
complexity filter is active, fixtures without an authored `complexity` value are
excluded; the matrix never infers complexity from directory names or HTML.

Suggested corpus migration for `blocks-engine/fixtures/websites`: add or update
`fixture.json` files incrementally as the corpus owner. Start by renaming authored
`class` keys to `fixture_class` while leaving the legacy alias support in SSI,
then add `capabilities`, `risk_profile`, and any `quality_budgets` only where a
human knows the fixture intent. Fixtures without reviewed metadata should remain
unknown and appear in `manifest_coverage.unknown_fixture_ids`; do not backfill
truth from directory names or HTML heuristics.

## Solved Fixture Corpus and Promotion

The Blocks Engine fixture corpus has a lifecycle:

- `fixtures/candidates/` — untracked raw generation output (`.gitignore`d).
- `fixtures/websites/` — active corpus under evaluation.
- `fixtures/solved/` — permanent regression fixtures.

When `--blocks-engine` is passed, the operator wrapper defaults `--fixture-root`
to `<blocks-engine>/fixtures` and discovers fixtures from both `websites/` and
`solved/`. A matrix created from a corpus parent includes `fixture_directories:
["websites", "solved"]` so the split is visible in artifacts.

Promote a fixture to `fixtures/solved/` only after a matrix run grades it
`solved_candidate`:

Use the target lane while iterating, then the target-plus-solved promotion lane
before promotion:

```bash
node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --static-site-importer . \
  --blocks-engine /path/to/blocks-engine \
  --target-fixture <id>

node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --static-site-importer . \
  --blocks-engine /path/to/blocks-engine \
  --target-fixture <id> \
  --promotion-gate
```

The promotion lane selects the active target plus every fixture under
`fixtures/solved/`, defaults to one fixture per isolated WP Codebox batch, and
requires every selected fixture to retain `solved_candidate`. A target that is
not solved or any `solved_regression` fails the aggregate.

CI can run the solved regression corpus without an active target:

```bash
node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --static-site-importer . \
  --blocks-engine /path/to/blocks-engine \
  --solved-only
```

`--solved-only` selects all and only valid fixture directories (those containing
`index.html` and valid optional manifest metadata) under `fixtures/solved/`. It rejects an empty solved corpus, forces
the existing `solved_candidate` acceptance gate, and defaults to one isolated WP
Codebox batch per fixture. Editor validation and gated exact visual parity remain
required; `--no-editor-validation`, `--no-visual-parity`, and
`--no-visual-parity-gate` fail before execution. It cannot be combined with the
target, promotion, or manifest selection flags because the lane must cover the
complete solved corpus. The replayable plan and operator summary identify this
lane as `fixtures-solved-only/v1` and include active, solved, and selected corpus
counts plus the full coverage inventory so CI artifacts prove the exact selection.

### Editor Presentation Evidence

New matrix runs emit `static-site-importer/editor-presentation-evidence/v3`.
Its `expected_identities_complete` field records whether the expected generated
stylesheet identities came from the complete Blocks Engine editor-presentation
asset contract. SSI compares those identities without reconstructing route policy.
A declared asset-count mismatch, upstream truncation marker, local evidence bound,
or missing stylesheet coverage prevents promotion.

The v3 evidence also requires an idle editor canvas without onboarding modals and
matched frontend/editor content rendering at equivalent canvas widths. It does not
require exact whole-window pixel equality because Gutenberg chrome and selection
affordances differ. It fails closed for major editor-content geometry drift,
unreadable or hidden content, unresolved assets, or missing comparison artifacts.
Legacy stylesheet-only evidence is insufficient; rerun the matrix to produce v3
evidence.

The solved-candidate gate also proves persisted Gutenberg editability. After
visual parity capture, it inserts a fixture-specific paragraph through
`wordpress.editor-actions`, saves with `core/editor.savePost`, reloads the editor,
and captures the reloaded state. A required runtime assertion verifies the marker
in the persisted front-page `post_content`, then `wp.blocks.validateBlock` runs
again against the post-save document. Any action, persistence, reload, or
post-save block-validity failure fails the fixture.

```bash
node tools/promote-solved-fixture.mjs \
  --fixture-id <id> \
  --registry /path/to/run/gutenberg-incompatibility-registry.json \
  --blocks-engine /path/to/blocks-engine
```

The tool refuses to move fixtures whose registry decision is not
`solved_candidate` (no `--force`). It performs the move with `git mv` and prints
the commit/push next steps.

A solved fixture that regresses in a later matrix run is surfaced as
`solved_regression` in the registry decision groups and counts. This is a hard
failure: solved fixtures must stay solved, and a regression requires either a fix
or a reviewed demotion back to `fixtures/websites/`.

## Generic Invocation

## Existing Runtime Review

`npm run review:existing-runtime -- ...` reviews one explicitly supplied running
WordPress candidate. It is a thin Playwright adapter over the matrix's shared PNG
comparison primitive; it does not create a fixture, invoke Homeboy or WP Codebox,
or modify the supplied candidate post. The required Studio authentication provider
and editor user ID are named rather than inferred; credential-bearing origins and
auto-login URLs are never written to artifacts.

```bash
npm run review:existing-runtime -- \
  --source-origin https://example.com \
  --candidate-origin http://localhost:8886 \
  --route / \
  --post-id 42 \
  --post-type pages \
  --editor-id 7 \
  --auth-provider studio-auto-login \
  --presentation-map /tmp/source-provider-presentation-map.json \
  --output-directory /tmp/ssi-existing-runtime-review
```

The result records the supplied origins, route, candidate post target, desktop and
mobile source/candidate/diff screenshots and pixel metrics, and real Gutenberg
`wp.blocks.validateBlock` results for REST-fetched persisted candidate content.
It identifies the browser provider as Playwright, not WP Codebox. It creates a
separate draft solely for edit/save/reload validation, verifies the reloaded REST
content contains its marker, force-deletes and verifies deletion in `finally`, and
then verifies the target content hash is unchanged. Any lifecycle cleanup failure,
nonzero pixel mismatch, or screenshot dimension mismatch fails the review.

### Semantic Editor Presentation

The existing-runtime review also requires a separate presentation result. Visible
block counts and valid save markup cannot satisfy it. An absent presentation map
produces a failed result, rather than falling back to the old visibility check.

Supply explicit source/frontend/editor selectors from the source and provider
mapping. Each target must resolve uniquely inside its corresponding container.
Containers establish comparable local coordinates and exclude WordPress chrome
and the editor's document-title field. Example:

```json
{
  "schema": "static-site-importer/editor-presentation-map/v1",
  "targets": [
    {
      "id": "contact-form",
      "role": "region",
      "selectors": {
        "source": "form#contact",
        "frontend": ".contact-section form",
        "editor": ".contact-section [data-type=\"jetpack/contact-form\"]"
      },
      "containers": {
        "source": ".contact-section",
        "frontend": ".contact-section",
        "editor": ".contact-section"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Declare the hero, paragraphs, form, individual labels/controls, submit button,
and other intended content as separate targets. Supported roles are `region`,
`heading`, `text`, `label`, `field`, `submit`, `image`, and `indicator`.
An optional indicator may be absent on the source; any unexpected visible match
on another surface fails. Hidden indicator nodes do not count as visible markers.
The map is capped at 128 targets and requires at least one content region for
pixel comparison. Only indicators can be optional. The report states
`coverage.scope: declared-targets`: passing a partial map is evidence only for
that map, not proof of whole-site coverage. No fuzzy text/ordinal matching or
implicit exclusions are used. Callers remain responsible for complete mapping.
For labels, target the provider's label wrapper including its visible adornments,
rather than only the nested editable text node. This is what exposes generated
required markers. Field values are never recorded; target text is bounded to 4096
characters, with overflow reported as missing evidence rather than truncated.

For desktop and mobile browser sizes, the collector measures the real editor
iframe's viewport and renders source/frontend at that width. It dismisses only
the known Gutenberg welcome preference, fails on remaining visible dialogs, and
waits for fonts, images, and stylesheet readiness. Background editor polling is
not a readiness requirement. Geometry is relative to the declared container;
text targets use rendered text bounds rather than unused inline/block width.
Region screenshots use the existing shared PNG comparison primitive. Before capture,
static/relative untransformed regions are temporarily positioned at integer raster
origins, with their original inline styles restored afterward. Original geometry,
aligned geometry, and offsets are retained. Geometry is compared before adjustment.
Transformed or fixed/sticky regions fail as unsupported capture evidence. Oversized
editor regions increase the bounded browser height before measurement; source and
frontend use the same resulting iframe viewport. Regions still exceeding it fail
as clipped evidence. This prevents subpixel raster noise and white iframe crop edges
from being misclassified as theme defects. Text bounds union non-whitespace text
ranges, preserving nested text and excluding invisible pre-wrap trailing spaces.
Any pixel mismatch or dimension mismatch still fails, even if DOM measurements match.
Map content regions rather than WordPress chrome. Idle selection is cleared before
capture; selection-state screenshots retain normal editing affordances and use
semantic measurements rather than requiring selection outlines to match the source.
Geometry differences over one CSS pixel fail. Computed typography, colors,
padding, borders, placeholder appearance, generated text, and whitespace-normalized
visible text are compared exactly. This includes pseudo-element required markers.

The collector also clicks mapped headings, labels, fields, and submit blocks,
confirms their identity in Gutenberg's selection store, and remeasures presentation
in each selected state. This establishes pointer selection and selected presentation;
it does not prove every provider-specific field-setting workflow.

Selecting a block is allowed to reveal authoring affordances, because that is what
a block editor does: Jetpack Forms renders an in-flow "Add help text…" row inside a
selected field, and a narrow viewport hands canvas height to the contextual block
toolbar. Neither is an import defect, and neither may be waved through as tolerance.
Before the first selection the resting canvas is marked, so any element that does not
exist at rest is an affordance that selection introduced. Each selected measurement
inventories those elements with their box sizes, takes them out of layout, measures,
and restores them. With affordances neutralized, every mapped target still owes the
source exact geometry, styles, and text, so a restyled label, a resized input, or a
dropped stylesheet fails exactly as it does at rest — neutralization never touches an
element that existed before selection. Canvas width must be unchanged; canvas height
is recorded as chrome on the check rather than compared. A selected-state difference
is reported in the top-level findings with its `selected_target`, so a failing check
can never be summarized as a passing one.
The existing isolated-draft save/reload check remains a separate result.
Per-target screenshots, region diff images, selected block screenshots, canvas screenshots, mapping,
browser version, actual viewport, raw measurements, matching coverage, and
structured differences are retained in `existing-runtime-review.json` and PNGs.
Missing, ambiguous, invisible, or incomplete evidence fails closed. Status strings
alone cannot satisfy the final acceptance predicate; raw measurements are checked.

The measurement regression runs against real Chromium documents and an iframe:

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
node --test tests/editor-presentation-browser.test.mjs tools/run-existing-runtime-review.test.mjs
```

It deliberately introduces form-width, label-gap, button-width, font-weight, and
required-marker defects while leaving the frontend correct. A dedicated browser
CI job runs these regressions. This PR strengthens **existing-runtime review**;
the WP Codebox fixture-matrix promotion provider retains its separate schema and
does not automatically consume this Playwright evidence.

The workload composes these generic surfaces:

- Homeboy rig package discovery and `bench_workloads.nodejs` registration.
- Repo-level `tools/wp-codebox/recipe.mjs` as a pass-through to Homeboy Extensions WP Codebox recipe execution when `--run` is explicitly provided.
- WP Codebox CLI availability and executable discovery are upstream runtime contract requirements, not rig-level fallback checks.
- WP Codebox `workspace-recipe/v1` steps using generic `wordpress.wp-cli`
  commands.
- WP Codebox `wordpress.editor-validate-blocks` command (#1597) for the
  editor-side block validity step (see below). Requires a wp-codebox build that
  includes #1597; older builds reject the recipe at schema validation.
- WP Codebox `wordpress.visual-compare` command for the pixel visual-parity step
  (see below).

SSI-specific behavior remains here: plugin slug/defaults, fixture artifact
packing, `static-site-importer validate-artifact` command construction,
artifact expectations, and diagnostic-to-repair grouping.

Use `--theme-materialization classic` on the operator wrapper, or set
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_THEME_MATERIALIZATION=classic`, to run the same runtime and
visual-parity evidence lane against SSI's managed classic-theme projection.
`block` remains the default.

## Editor Block Validity Gate

The PHP `validate-artifact` step proves blocks *serialize* (PHP
`parse_blocks`/`serialize_blocks` round-trip). It does **not** run the editor's
JS save-comparison validation, which is what surfaces the "This block contains
unexpected or invalid content" warning users actually see.

After each fixture's import step, `buildFixtureMatrixRecipe` appends a
`wordpress.editor-validate-blocks` step (#1597) that runs the editor's real
`wp.blocks.validateBlock` pass (same WP Codebox sandbox) and emits per-block
`{ name, isValid, issues }` results plus `total_blocks`/`valid_blocks`/
`invalid_blocks`. This reuses the existing wp-codebox editor-validation command
rather than rebuilding a validator.

Solved-site promotion additionally requires the WP Codebox artifact schema,
`wordpress-block-editor` provider, `edited-post-content` source, a nonzero
registered block-type count, and one complete recursive result per reported
block. Counts-only or detached-content validation cannot satisfy promotion.

The default `front-page` target resolves at runtime to the imported
`page_on_front`, so validation exercises real imported content even though its
post ID is not known while the recipe is generated.

`collectEditorValidationDiagnostics` reads the probe's `selectorSummary`
(invalid-warning matches) — and, when present, per-block `isValid`/`validateBlock`
results — back into `editor_block_invalid` diagnostics. These classify into the
Blocks Engine feature/visual-parity bucket (`candidate_repo: blocks-engine`,
`repair_mode: editor-block-validation-parity`) with the unacceptable
`editor_block_invalid` loss class, so the honest gate fails the fixture. Valid
blocks emit nothing. Set `--no-editor-validation` /
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_EDITOR_VALIDATION=0` / `editorValidation: false` to omit the
step (the slowest per-site step, it launches a browser per fixture); the run
still produces native-rate, loss-classes, pattern-families, and the rest of the
findings — just no `validateBlock` editor-validity data.

## Editor Chrome Probe

Per surface, the matrix also emits a `wordpress.editor-canvas-probe` step that
probes the imported post's real editor canvas for visible placeholder and
invalid-block warnings (`editor_visible_placeholder` selector group). Its
evidence stays separate from the `wordpress.editor-validate-blocks` step: block
validation runs the editor's `wp.blocks.validateBlock` pass, while the chrome
probe observes what the canvas actually renders.

The Codebox `editor-canvas-probe` contract only accepts a literal
`url=<path-or-url>` argument: unlike its sibling editor commands it has no
post-id/post-slug/front-page target interpreter and installs no WordPress admin
auth itself (#1965). Because an imported surface's numeric post ID is only known
after the import step runs, the chrome probe cannot carry a literal admin edit
URL at recipe-build time and must not substitute a front-end source URL. Instead:

- `buildFixtureMatrixRecipe` stages one matrix-owned runtime resolver per
  fixture (`editor-chrome-target.php` at the WordPress document root) right
  after import. It resolves a surface identity with the same primitives as the
  materialized-surface-identity receipt — `page_on_front` for the front page and
  `get_page_by_path` for secondary routes — then signs the probe browser in as
  the sandbox admin (`wp_set_auth_cookie`) and redirects to the imported post's
  canonical admin edit URL (`get_edit_post_link`). It is disposable sandbox
  plumbing owned by the matrix recipe, not a product route.
- `editorChromeValidationStep` always targets an explicit editor URL: an
  explicit `editor_url` wins, a build-time post ID becomes
  `/wp-admin/post.php?post=<id>&action=edit`, and otherwise the step targets the
  runtime resolver with the surface identity (`?surface=<slug>&post_type=page`).
  Unknown surfaces fail the probe as `editor_chrome_target_unavailable` instead
  of silently probing a different page.

Upstream ownership: aligning `editor-canvas-probe` with its sibling editor
commands (post-id/post-slug/front-page targeting plus `wordpress-admin` auth)
belongs in WP Codebox; until such a contract lands there, this resolver keeps
the generated recipes valid against the installed Codebox validator without
weakening its schema or dropping chrome evidence.

## Bounded Surface Coverage

Browser evidence defaults to the imported front page only. Multi-page evidence is
opt-in with `--surface-coverage <n>` on the operator wrapper, or
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_SURFACE_COVERAGE=<n>` / `SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_MAX_EXTRA_SURFACES=<n>`
for the bench. The matrix caps requested secondary pages at `5` extra surfaces
per fixture, keeps HTML paths sorted lexicographically, and emits a
`surface_coverage` summary plus `surface_coverage_runtime_cost` warning so run
cost is visible before execution.

Surface artifact names are deterministic and collision-safe. If two HTML entries
map to the same route-derived ID, such as `about.html` and `about/index.html`,
the later surface receives a stable suffix (`about--2`) for editor-open artifact
prefixes and visual comparison names.

Live caveat: the `editor-validate-blocks` step runs locally in WP Codebox today
(see "Running the matrix locally" below) — a real local recipe-run executed the
step and returned `validation_method: wp.blocks.validateBlock`,
`blockTypesRegistered: 109`. The wiring and the finding-parsing/gating logic are
unit-tested in `tools/fixture-matrix.test.mjs`. The remaining enablement for a
true imported-content assertion is targeting the imported post rather than a
blank editor (gap documented above).

## Pixel Visual Parity Gate

Structural, feature, and editor-block validity all run *without ever rendering a
browser*. After each fixture's import step, `buildFixtureMatrixRecipe` appends a
`wordpress.visual-compare` step that renders the fixture's original static source
vs the imported WordPress candidate in the same WP Codebox sandbox and emits
`source.png`/`candidate.png`/`diff.png` plus `mismatch_pixels`/`total_pixels`.
SSI sends the command as a one-entry `matrix-json` comparison so wp-codebox writes
screenshots under `files/browser/visual-compare/<fixture-id>/...`; batch runs keep
per-fixture visual evidence instead of overwriting every fixture into the default
`files/browser/visual-compare/{source,candidate,diff}.png` paths. This is the
exact recipe command the reusable `runVisualParityWorkload` helper composes in
homeboy-extensions — the matrix emits it inline rather than spinning up a
separate sandbox, so no new wp-codebox capability is introduced.

Visual-parity capture is intentionally deterministic. SSI stages the static
source with a small `data-ssi-visual-parity-deterministic` style block that
finishes CSS animations/transitions and makes reveal/page-load elements visible;
after import, the recipe installs the same CSS into the WordPress candidate via
`wp_update_custom_css_post()` before taking screenshots. The visual compare step
uses `waitFor=duration` with a fixed settle duration (`4000ms` by default) so both
source and candidate are captured after DOM readiness plus the same settling
window. Operators can override the settle contract with
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_WAIT_FOR` and
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_DURATION_MS` while investigating capture issues.

`collectVisualParityDiagnostics` reads the comparison back out (from either the
raw `wp-codebox/visual-compare/v1` diff, a `wp-codebox/visual-compare-matrix/v1`
summary, or a normalized `homeboy/VisualParityArtifact/v1` artifact). When the
per-fixture `source.png` and `candidate.png` are available, SSI re-scores them with
a deterministic bounded translation search before gating. The default search is
vertical ±64px and horizontal 0px: this tolerates whole-page/header reflow without
hiding horizontal layout drift. The gate uses `aligned_mismatch_ratio` when it is
available and falls back to the dimension-fair overlap ratio for older evidence.
`raw_mismatch_ratio` remains in diagnostics/artifacts for continuity.

Alignment reports `detected_offset` separately. Offsets above the reporting
tolerance emit a non-gating `visual_parity_offset` diagnostic so real drift remains
visible and fixable while shifted-but-present content is not mis-scored as missing.
Findings route to the visual-parity repair bucket (`candidate_repo: blocks-engine`,
`repair_mode: visual-parity`). The screenshots, diff, and metrics are also
captured into the SSI `visual_parity_artifacts` slot
(`static-site-importer/visual-parity-artifacts/v1`) on the fixture result, even
when the gate is off.

The dev-loop wrapper gates visual parity by default because the fixture matrix is
deterministic transformer feedback: a fidelity gate that ignores fidelity is not
honest. Pass `--no-visual-parity-gate` /
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_GATE=0` for exploratory capture-only runs. The
mismatch threshold is configurable via `--pixel-threshold` /
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_PIXEL_THRESHOLD` (default exact parity, `0`).
Alignment is enabled by default and can be configured with
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_ALIGNMENT=0`,
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_MAX_VERTICAL_SHIFT`,
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_MAX_HORIZONTAL_SHIFT`, and
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_OFFSET_TOLERANCE` (default `2` px). The
alignment scorer uses `SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_VISUAL_PARITY_PIXELMATCH_THRESHOLD`
(default `0.1`) as its per-pixel anti-alias/color tolerance; this is separate from
the mismatch-ratio gate threshold. Set `--no-visual-parity` /
`visualParity: false` to omit the step entirely.

Visual-attribution depth is opt-in and uses WP Codebox's public matrix fields.
Pass `--max-explanation-elements <n>`, `--max-explanation-candidates <n>`, and
`--explain-selectors <selector[,selector...]>` through the operator wrapper, or
set `SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_MAX_EXPLANATION_ELEMENTS`,
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_MAX_EXPLANATION_CANDIDATES`, and
`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_EXPLAIN_SELECTORS` for direct bench runs. Positive integer
limits and trimmed, de-duplicated selector lists are forwarded to every visual
comparison as `maxExplanationElements`, `maxExplanationCandidates`, and
`explainSelectors`. Leaving them unset preserves WP Codebox's defaults and the
existing recipe JSON.

For deterministic animated-image capture, pass `--animated-media first-frame` or
set `SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_ANIMATED_MEDIA=first-frame`. The supported policies are
`allow` (the WP Codebox default) and `first-frame`; the selected effective policy
is recorded as `metadata.animated_media` in `cli-run.json`.

Source/candidate wiring (verified by real local recipe-runs): the
`wordpress.visual-compare` step renders and pixel-diffs locally in WP Codebox
against the real two pages. `writeFixtureMatrixArtifacts` stages each fixture's
ORIGINAL static source (index.html + css/js/images) into
`<artifacts>/<id>/source/...`, with only the deterministic capture CSS added to
HTML files. The step composes
`source-url=file://<artifacts>/<id>/source/index.html` and `candidate-url=/`.
Because each fixture's import step runs with `activate=true` — which sets
`show_on_front=page` + `page_on_front` to the imported front page — and the recipe
interleaves `[import, visual-setup, visual-compare]` per fixture, `/` resolves to
THIS fixture's imported front page at capture time, the real imported WordPress
output. A fixture can override `source_url`/`candidate_url` to target a specific
staged page or imported permalink. The wiring, source-staging, finding-parsing,
threshold, deterministic setup, and gating logic are unit-tested in
`tools/fixture-matrix.test.mjs`.

Capture is full-page by default. wp-codebox's URL-target default is also
full-page, but SSI previously overrode it with `full-page=false`, which limited
the evidence to the requested viewport and missed below-the-fold regressions. Use
`visualParityFullPage: false` only for an explicitly bounded exploratory run.

WP Codebox supports `animatedMedia` through `matrix-json`; SSI forwards the
optional animated-media policy to every front and secondary surface comparison.

## Running the Matrix

## Runtime Media Presentation Evidence

`SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_RUNTIME_PRESENTATION_EVIDENCE=1` (or
`--runtime-presentation-evidence true`) adds opt-in `wordpress.browser-probe`
steps and one deterministic merge step before `static-site-importer validate-artifact`. The probe waits for explicit
`networkidle` readiness and requests only the Blocks Engine v1 media observation
shape: Chromium/version, viewport/DPR, source path and stable selector, normalized
asset hash, intrinsic/rendered dimensions, transform matrix/origin, and nearest
clipping bounds. Default static intake does not add this step or alter artifacts.

Replay for mrfoxtalbot:

```sh
SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_RUNTIME_PRESENTATION_EVIDENCE=1 \
node bench/static-site-fixture-matrix.bench.mjs --run \
  --fixture-ids mrfoxtalbot --fixture-root <fixtures> \
  --static-site-importer-path /Users/chubes/Developer/static-site-importer@feat-796-runtime-media-evidence
```

For fixture `<id>`, every selected surface is probed before the single merge:
the front page uses
`output-artifact=<id>/runtime-presentation-evidence.json`, and each secondary
surface uses `output-artifact=<id>/runtime-presentation-evidence--<surface-id>.json`.
Playground recipes declare the matching fixture- and surface-scoped
`output-runtime-path=/wordpress/.../<id>/runtime-presentation-evidence[--<surface-id>].json`.
Each observation records that surface's HTML entry path, such as `team.html`,
as `element.source_path`.

The merge confines every evidence path to the fixture directory under the
declared runtime artifact root and accepts only typed Blocks Engine envelopes.
It requires identical browser, viewport, and lifecycle provenance across every
envelope; rejects duplicate `(source_path, selector)` observations; and fails
explicitly if the aggregate exceeds Blocks Engine's 100-observation limit. It
then atomically writes a sibling
`<id>/artifact-with-runtime-presentation-evidence.json` containing the
`runtime_presentation_evidence` field. Only then does `validate-artifact`
compile that derived artifact. A missing output, malformed envelope,
provenance mismatch, duplicate observation, aggregate limit, unavailable root,
or boundary violation emits a structured
`runtime_presentation_evidence_unavailable` diagnostic and fails before
compilation rather than compiling without the requested input.

The wrapper has three execution modes. Use `--dry-run` with any mode to inspect
the composed Homeboy commands before running the matrix.

### Local Placement

`homeboy bench` receives typed placement explicitly. To run the matrix on this
machine against local checkouts, a local fixture root, and a local WP Codebox,
pass `--local` to `tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs`. The wrapper passes
`--placement local` to the bench command. Local setup commands remain local
because `homeboy rig install` and `homeboy rig sync` do not support placement.
Lab execution translates component/checkout paths into the remote workspace but forwards
`--shared-state`/`--artifact-root` verbatim, so local-only paths fail on the
runner (`Permission denied`).

```
node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --local \
  --static-site-importer <ssi-checkout> \
  --blocks-engine <blocks-engine-checkout> \
  --fixture-root <dir-of-fixture-subdirs> \
  --wp-codebox-bin <wp-codebox>/packages/cli/dist/index.js
```

`--runner local` is accepted as an alias for `--local`. The wrapper maps it to
the same `--placement local` bench plan and does not pass `--runner local`
through to Homeboy.

### Lab Offload

To offload to the connected Lab runner, select the runner and omit `--local`:

```
node tools/run-fixture-matrix.mjs \
  --runner homeboy-lab \
  --static-site-importer <ssi-checkout> \
  --blocks-engine <blocks-engine-checkout>
```

This passes `--placement lab --runner homeboy-lab` to Homeboy. Use `--lab-only`
without `--local` when any Lab runner is acceptable; it passes `--placement lab`
without a named runner.

Use `--allow-local-fallback` when a Lab preference may fall back to the local
machine. The wrapper passes `--placement lab-or-local` (and preserves a named
`--runner` when supplied).

### Default / Auto Routing

With no `--local`, `--runner`, `--lab-only`, or `--allow-local-fallback`, the wrapper passes
`--placement auto` to `homeboy bench`. Homeboy selects the execution location
from its command contract, controller pressure, and ready Lab capacity. If you
need deterministic local execution, pass `--local`; if you need deterministic
Lab execution, pass `--runner <id>` or `--lab-only`.

Mutual-exclusion rules:

- `--local` cannot be combined with `--runner <remote>`.
- `--local` cannot be combined with `--lab-only`.
- `--allow-local-fallback` selects `lab-or-local` placement and cannot be
  combined with `--local` or `--lab-only`.
- Pick exactly one explicit target for deterministic runs: local (`--local`) or
  Lab (`--runner homeboy-lab` / `--lab-only`).

Notes:
- The `editor-validate-blocks` step (#1597) requires a wp-codebox build that
  includes #1597. The build homeboy materializes at
  `~/.cache/homeboy/wp-codebox/source` can lag upstream `main`; if it predates
  #1597 the recipe is rejected at schema validation
  (`steps[N].command must be equal to one of the allowed values`). Point
  `--wp-codebox-bin` at a current-`main` build to unblock it.
- The rig `check` pipeline asserts the SSI checkout exists
  (`<ssi>/static-site-importer.php`). If the checkout/worktree was removed (e.g.
  by workspace hygiene), the bench fails with `rig.pipeline_failed` on the
  `check` step — recreate the checkout before running.
- Fixture roots must contain real fixture subdirectories with `index.html`.
    Symlinked fixture directories are excluded. Execution and promotion lanes fail
    closed when selection is empty or coverage reports malformed/duplicate/omitted
    fixtures; `--dry-run` instead prints the active and solved inventory with
    bounded reasons and selected IDs. Copy fixtures in rather than symlinking.

## Editor-Quality Metrics

Beyond flagging editor-invalid blocks and losses, the matrix scores how *native
and editable* each import is. `collectBlockComposition` surfaces the transformer's
generic block-composition breakdown — the per-block-type counts / `detectBlockTypes`
output already carried on the import artifact (including the copy SSI preserves at
`import_report.blocks_engine.conversion_report.block_type_counts`) — and from that
computes, per fixture and as a corpus aggregate:

- `native_conversion_rate` = native core/Automattic blocks ÷ total blocks
- `core_html_fallback_ratio` = `core/html` blocks ÷ total blocks
- `editor_invalid_count` = reuse of the `editor_block_invalid` findings (above)

A block is **native** when it lives in a core or known Automattic namespace
(`core/*`, `jetpack/*`, `woocommerce/*`, `automattic/*`, `a8c/*`) and is not one
of the non-native fallback wrappers (`core/html`, `core/freeform`). This namespace
list is the *only* basis — there is **no per-fixture knowledge**, no hardcoded
fixture ids or classes. When no per-block-type breakdown is present but SSI's
quality report carries a total block count plus fallback counts, the composition
is derived from those counts (native ≈ non-fallback remainder); when neither is
available the fixture is left unscored rather than fabricating numbers.

The per-fixture score lands on each fixture result as `editor_quality`, rolls up
into `summary.editor_quality` (aggregate rates recomputed from summed totals, not
an average of per-fixture rates), and into each `summary.classes[*].editor_quality`
/ `summary.quality_budgets[*].editor_quality` class rollup.

Scoring is always on and non-gating. An **opt-in** native-conversion gate (off by
default, mirroring `--visual-parity-gate`) flips low-native fixtures to failing:
pass `--min-native-rate <ratio>` (run wrapper) / `SSI_FIXTURE_MATRIX_MIN_NATIVE_RATE`
(accepts a `0–1` ratio or a percentage like `80`). Each scored fixture below the
threshold earns an unacceptable `low_native_conversion` finding
(`native_conversion_rate_below_min`, routed to `candidate_repo: blocks-engine`,
`repair_mode: native-conversion-parity`) so it fails the same honest gate as other
unacceptable losses. Default runs never emit it, so existing matrix behavior is
unchanged.

## Generated Artifact Intake Contract

`--artifact-root` accepts any directory containing one or more generated static
site artifacts. Discovery is structural, not fixture-specific:

- A directory with `index.html` becomes one fixture.
- A directory with `website/index.html` becomes one fixture from `website/`.
- A directory with `artifact.json`, `website-artifact.json`, or
  `static-site-candidate.json` containing `files[].path` entries under
  `website/` becomes one materialized fixture.

The bridge writes normal fixture directories under the requested fixture root,
then the existing matrix path discovers them and writes `<fixture-id>/artifact.json`
for SSI validation.
